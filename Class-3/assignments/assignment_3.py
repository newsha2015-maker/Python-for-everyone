Assignment 3: Operator Overloading

1.  Create a `Vector` class that represents a 2D vector with `x` and `y` components.
2.  Implement the `__add__` method to add two `Vector` objects together.
3.  Implement the `__sub__` method to subtract one `Vector` from another.
4.  Implement the `__mul__` method to perform scalar multiplication (multiplying a `Vector` by a number).
5.  Create two `Vector` objects and demonstrate that your implemented operators work correctly.
