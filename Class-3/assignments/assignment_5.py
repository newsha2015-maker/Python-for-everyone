Assignment 5: Sorting Algorithm

1.  Write a function that implements the "selection sort" algorithm.
2.  The function should take a list of numbers as input and return the sorted list.
3.  Test your function with a sample list of unsorted numbers.
4.  (Bonus) Time how long your selection sort function takes to sort a large list of random numbers. Compare this to Python's built-in `sort()` method.
