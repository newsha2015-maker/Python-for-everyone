Assignment 1: Exception Handling

1.  Write a script that asks the user for two numbers and then divides them.
2.  Use a `try...except` block to handle the `ZeroDivisionError` that occurs if the user enters 0 for the second number. Print a user-friendly error message in this case.
3.  Use another `try...except` block to handle the `ValueError` that occurs if the user enters a non-numeric value.
4.  Add a `finally` block that prints "Calculation complete."
