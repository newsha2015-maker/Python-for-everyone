Assignment 5: OOP Project

1.  Create a `Rectangle` class.
2.  The class should have `width` and `height` attributes.
3.  Create a method to calculate the area of the rectangle.
4.  Create a method to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.
5.  Create a `Square` class that inherits from the `Rectangle` class.
6.  The `Square` class should have only one attribute, `side_length`, but it should use the `width` and `height` attributes of the parent class.
7.  Ensure the area and perimeter methods work correctly for the `Square` class.
