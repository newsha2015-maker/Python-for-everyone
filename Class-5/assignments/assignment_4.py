Assignment 4: Data Visualization with Matplotlib

1.  Create a NumPy array `x` with numbers from 0 to 10.
2.  Create a NumPy array `y` that is the square of `x` (`y = x**2`).
3.  Create a line plot of `y` vs `x`.
4.  Add a title to the plot, and labels for the x and y axes.
5.  Create a second plot (a scatter plot) of a different function, for example `z = x**3`.
