Assignment 2: Scope

1.  Create a global variable `my_name` and assign it your name.
2.  Write a function that tries to modify this global variable.
3.  Write another function that creates a local variable with the same name (`my_name`) and prints it.
4.  Print the global variable outside of the functions to show that it hasn't changed.
